about-me-text:
  I'm **Oskar Norberg**, an **Engine & Tools** programmer from Stockholm, Sweden. 
  My passion lies in creating **tools & software** to aid in content creation. 
  With experience in both **standalone/desktop C++** along with **Unreal Engine** and **Unity** 
  I'm interested in **rendering**, **performance** and **architecting** competent systems with **modularity** and **scalability**.


  Outside of programming I also enjoy **photography**, **movies** and **music**. 
  My favorite type of photography is **architectural** and **urban photography**, some of which you can see on my blog [[not created]]. 
  Despite being **a bit forgetful**, I'll never forget to bring my camera along for a trip.
